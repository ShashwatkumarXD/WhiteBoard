# WhiteBoard

I've created a digital whiteboard where you can draw for fun using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to explore and learn the workings of JavaScript, particularly in handling events, manipulating the DOM, and working with canvas elements. It was a hands-on experience that helped me understand how to create interactive and dynamic features on a webpage. The project serves as a fun and practical tool while also showcasing my growing skills in front-end web development.
